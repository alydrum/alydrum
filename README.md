## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Alyssa Drum 
I am a senior majoring in Information Technology and minoring in Secure Computing and Networks (SCAN). My passion for cybersecurity began during my spring 2020 semester when I enrolled in the CodePath Cybersecurity course offered at my university. Since then, I continued to focus on learning cybersecurity concepts, especially penetration testing. I, then, use resources I find online such as HackTheBox, TryHackMe, Immersive Lab, etc. to supplement my learning. I also enjoy attending cyber/infosec conferences and plan I to participate in more CTF competitions.  

### Portfolio
I plan to use my Github to post my cybersecurity learning journey, such as any achievements I've accomplished, post write-ups (from HackTheBox & TryHackMe machines/rooms I've done), etc.
