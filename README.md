## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Alyssa Drum 
I graduated with a major in Information Technology and a minor in Secure Computing and Network (SCAN). My passion for cyber security began during my spring 2020 semester when I enrolled in the CodePath Cyber Security course offered at my university. Since then, I've focused on learning basic cyber security concepts with a focus on penetration testing. I, then, use resources I find online such as HackTheBox, TryHackMe, Immersive Lab, etc. to supplement my learning. I also enjoy attending cyber/infosec conferences and I want to participate in more CTF competitions.  

### Portfolio
I am going to be using this portfolio to post my cybersecurity learning journey. Showing any achievements I've accomplished, post write-ups (from HackTheBox machines, TryHackMe rooms, CTF challenges), etc.
